This is an OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Banking System that allowed the user to input their credentials, create a new account, and perform transactions such as deposits and withdrawals. 
The system uses a Bank class to manage account details and transactions. Users can either create a new account or interact with an existing one by providing their account number. 
Once an account is created or selected, the user can view their balance, deposit funds, or withdraw money. 
The system checks for sufficient balance during withdrawals and updates the account information accordingly. 
By utilizing encapsulation and abstraction, the system provides a user-friendly interface while keeping the internal data and methods organized and secure.
